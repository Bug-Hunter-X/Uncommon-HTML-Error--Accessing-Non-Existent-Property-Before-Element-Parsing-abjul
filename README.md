# Uncommon HTML Error: Accessing Non-Existent Property Before Element Parsing

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error where JavaScript code tries to access a property of a DOM element before the browser has fully parsed the element. This often leads to a runtime error such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'style')`.

The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version using event listeners to ensure the code runs after the element is ready.

This kind of error can be tricky to debug because it is timing-sensitive and may not occur consistently across all browsers or environments.
